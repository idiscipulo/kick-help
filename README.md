# Final Project: Kick-Help API
#### Isaiah Discipulo
## Overview
For this project I created a Python API to predict the success of a Kickstarter campaign, called Kick-Help. Kick-Help uses a neural network to estimate the probability of success for a given campaign. This project was concieved at the Sunhacks hackathon, in collaboration with Luis Gomez and Sam Rondinelli. I have since spent the last month improving the API as a solo developer.
## Data
To train my model, I used a dataset of Kickstarter projects, posted on Kaggle by user Kemical. The dataset included over 380,000 projects with several parameters, including Kickstarter category, duration of fundraising, USD goal, and project success. Below is a sample of the raw dataset.

Although I have not confirmed it, I would guess that this dataset was generated by scraping Kickstarter. Unfortunately, certain scraping techniques can be less reliable than say, a Kickstarter API, and the dataset had many flaws. I wrote several functions in Python to clean the data and transfrom it to a useable state.
#### clean
The `clean` function is the top-level command to clean the data. It reads in a csv file, extracting from each line the project name, duration of fundraising, USD goal, and project success. Some of the categories in the dataset are no longer valid Kickstarter categories, so those projects are thrown out. Additionally, I was only interested in projects that completed their fundraising run and either succeded or failed. Many projects in the dataset were cancelled or suspended prior to completing their fundraising run, so those projects were thrown out. The remaining projects had their category enumerated, their duration converted to raw numbers, and were stored in another csv file.
```
def clean(infile, outfile):
	# init
	raw_project_count = 0
	clean_project_count = 0
	clean_successful_count = 0
	clean_failed_count = 0
	# read from csv
	print('Cleaning Project List...')
	with open(infile, 'r', encoding='latin-1') as csvfile:
		reader = csv.DictReader(csvfile)
		data = [r for r in reader]
		x = []
		# clean
		for p in data:
			try:
				name = p['name'].lower()
				category = p['category'].lower()
				duration = get_duration(p['launched'], p['deadline'])
				goal = p['goal']
				outcome = p['state']
				if outcome == 'successful' and category in CATEGORIES:
					category = get_category(category)
					new_p = make_project(name, category, duration, goal, 1)
					x.append(new_p)
				elif outcome == 'failed' and category in CATEGORIES:
					category = get_category(category)
					new_p = make_project(name, category, duration, goal, 0)
					x.append(new_p)
			except:
				pass
	# write to csv
	print('Writing Clean List...')
	with open(outfile, 'w', encoding='latin-1') as csvfile:
		keys = list(x[0].keys())
		writer = csv.DictWriter(csvfile, fieldnames=keys, lineterminator='\n')
		writer.writeheader()
		for p in x:
			writer.writerow(p)	
	# summary
	raw_project_count = len(data)
	clean_project_count = len(x)
	clean_successful_count = sum(p['outcome'] == 1 for p in x)
	clean_failed_count = sum(p['outcome'] == 0 for p in x)
	print('Raw Project Count:', raw_project_count)
	print('Clean Project Count:', clean_project_count)
	print('Clean Succesful Count:', clean_successful_count)
	print('Clean Failed Count:', clean_failed_count)
```
#### get_category
The `get_category` function is a helper function for `clean` that enumerates the Kickstarter category variable.
```
CATEGORIES = ['games', 'design', 'technology', 'film & video', 'music', 'fashion', 'publishing', 'food', 'art', 'comics', 'theater', 'photography', 'crafts', dance', 'journalism']
			
def  get_category(category):
	return CATEGORIES.index(category)
```
#### get_duration
The `get_duration` function is a helper function for `clean` that converts the datetime formats for the project start and finish times into raw integer values and returns the difference.
```
def get_duration(launched, deadline):
    t1 = datetime.strptime(launched[0:18], '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
    t2 = datetime.strptime(deadline[0:18], '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
    t3 = t2 - t1
    return(str(t3.total_seconds()))
 ```
 #### make_project
 The `make_project` function is a helper function for `clean` that converts the data taken from the raw dataset into the desired format for the clean dataset.
 ```
 def make_project(name, category, duration, goal, outcome):
	data = {'name': '', 'category': '', 'duration': '', 'goal': '', 'outcome': ''}
	data['category'] = category
	data['duration'] = duration
	data['goal'] = goal
	data['name'] = name
	data['outcome'] = outcome
	return data
 ```
 Below is a sample of the clean dataset.

## Model
To model the success of Kickstarter projects I chose to use a neural network. My motivations behind this were twofold: I had no initial hypothesis about the relationship between the features and success and I have been wanting to learn the TensorFlow and Keras libraries for a while. For the features, I chose to use Kickstarter category, duration of fundraising, and USD goal. My output is binary: did the project succeed or fail at being funded.
#### load_data
The `load_data` function reads the data from the clean dataset and converts it into the necessary format for a keras neural network: a numpy array of type `float32`.
```
def load_data(infile):
	x_train = []
	y_train = []
	# load
	with open(infile, 'r', encoding='latin-1') as csvfile:
		reader = csv.DictReader(csvfile)
		data = [r for r in reader]
	v_stack = np.empty((0, 3), dtype='float32')
	# format
	for p in data:
		category = np.float32(p['category'])
		duration = np.float32(p['duration'])
		goal = np.float32(p['goal'])
		features = [category, duration, goal]
		h_stack = np.hstack(features)
		v_stack = np.vstack([v_stack, h_stack])
		y_train.append(p['outcome'])
	x_train = np.array(v_stack)
	y_train = np.array(y_train)
	return x_train, y_train
```
